| Board | MCU | Display | Input | SubGHz | NFC | IR | SD Card |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LilyGo T-Embed CC1101** | ESP32-S3 (Xtensa LX7) | ST7789 320×170 | Rotary encoder + button | CC1101 | PN532 (I2C) | RMT TX + RX | SPI |
| **Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.9** | ESP32-C6 (RISC-V) | ST7789V2 320×172 | CST816S touch | — | — | — | SPI |
| **Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47** ⚠️ | ESP32-C6 (RISC-V) | JD9853 320×172 | AXS5106L touch | — | — | — | SPI |
| **DIY ESP32-S3 with 2.8" TFT** ⚠️ | ESP32-S3 (Xtensa LX7) | 2.8" ILI9341 320×240 | 6× Tactile buttons | CC1101 | PN532 (I2C) | TX | SPI |


> ⚠️ **Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 — supported but barely usable.** The board builds, boots and the UI/touch work, but the ESP32-C6 has only **512 KB SRAM and no PSRAM**. RAM-heavy apps are effectively non-functional. In particular **WiFi**: a normal AP scan works, but **monitor mode / handshake capture fails** — by the time the app's buffers are allocated the WiFi driver can no longer allocate its DMA buffers (`esf_buf_setup_static: alloc eb fail` → `ESP_ERR_NO_MEM`), so no frames are received. Treat this board as usable only for lightweight apps until the WiFi app's memory footprint is reduced (it was designed for the PSRAM-equipped T-Embed).

> ⚠️ **DIY ESP32-S3 with 2.8" TFT** - Currently supported via a fork pending full integration, work in progress, ready to flash bins also available in the discord, updated each release

## How to Flash

The easiest way is the **web flasher** — no toolchain required, just a Chrome/Edge browser and a USB cable:

**[Flash via Browser](https://sor3nt.github.io/interface.html)**

Connect your board, click flash, done. After flashing, copy the contents of [sdcard.zip](https://github.com/Sor3nt/Flipper-Zero-ESP32-Port/releases/latest/download/sdcard.zip) onto a FAT32 SD card and insert it — most apps need files there to function.

## Firmware Update

Since **v2.0.0** the T-Embed can update itself — no PC toolchain or re-flashing required:

- **Over WiFi (OTA):** *Settings → Update Firmware* checks the release server for a newer build,
  downloads and installs it in the background, then reboots. It also keeps your SD card files in sync.
- **Over USB:** use the **[qT-Embed](https://github.com/Sor3nt/qT-Embed)** desktop companion (a
  qFlipper-style app for this port) to stream the display, manage SD files and flash firmware over
  USB — including a *Full flash* option (bootloader + partition table + firmware) to recover a device.

> Requires the dual-OTA partition layout. A device on the old single-app layout has to be flashed
> once via the web flasher (or qT-Embed's *Full flash*) before wireless OTA updates work.

## Apps

### 📡 Wireless / RF

#### Sub-GHz
External CC1101 receiver/transmitter for 433–868 MHz signals.
- Receive & decode
- Read RAW: capture unknown waveforms to `.sub` files for later analysis
- Frequency analyzer with sweep & live RSSI
- **RF Spectrum Analyzer** — colorful, HackRF-style live spectrum view
- Hopper: scan all preset bands during receive
- Transmit saved files; manual signal creation (frequency, modulation, protocol, key/serial/counter)
- Brute force / sub-brute attack with manufacturer dictionary
- Playlist for sequential transmit
- **More protocols** — added KeeLoq variants (ERREKA, PUJOL, AERF, SIMPLE_JCM), Agilize Key Pro and Holtek HT6P20B
- **TPMS decoding** — tire-pressure sensors: Schrader GG4, Citroën, Ford, Renault, Toyota (PMV107J) and a generic decoder; dedicated info view with editable sensor data
- **Limitation:** AES-encrypted manufacturer keystores (`keeloq_mfcodes`, `nice_flor_s`, `alutech_at_4n`) are not decryptable on this port — only the plain-text `keeloq_mfcodes_user` works for Keeloq decoding.

#### Sub-GHz Remote
Multi-button remote layouts that batch saved `.sub` files. Map Up/Down/Left/Right/OK to individual transmit signals; switch between persistent remote profiles.

#### WiFi
Full WiFi pentest toolkit.
- **Scanner** — SSID, BSSID, channel, RSSI, auth mode
- **Connect** — auto-detect WPA/WPA2/WPA3, password input or saved password lookup (`/ext/wifi/<ssid>.txt`)
- **Deauther** — SSID-mode (single AP) or Channel-mode (all on channel)
- **Smart Deauth** — targeted, station-aware deauthentication
- **Sniffer** — capture packets to PCAP (saved to `/ext/wifi/`)
- **Handshake capture** — record EAPOL 4-way handshakes, optionally with deauth trigger
- **AirSnitch** — auto-bruteforce target with password list

- **Evil Portal** — captive portal with credential harvesting
  - Built-in templates: Google login, Router firmware update
  - Custom templates from `/ext/wifi/evil_portal/login_template/*.html` and `/ext/wifi/evil_portal/router_template/*.html` (filename = template name in dropdown)
  - Marker substitution: `%ERROR%`, `%SSID_OPTIONS%` (live AP scan)
  - Router-style verify flow: dropdown of real SSIDs, live WLAN re-auth check, captured-credentials screen on success, retry with error banner on fail
  - Pause/Resume of the AP from the run screen
  - Captured creds saved to `/ext/wifi/evil_portal/<ssid>_creds.csv`
  - **Internet bridge** *(new)* — optional STA uplink with NAPT + DNS forwarding so victims get real internet behind the portal; iOS captive-portal "Success" handling; uplink SSID/password configured in-app
- **Web-Filesystem** — HTTP file server for the SD card; open it in a browser (device hotspot *or* your existing WiFi) to upload, download, rename and delete files, with drag & drop for whole folders
- **SMB Browser** — browse and download from SMB2/3 network shares (Windows / macOS / NAS) straight to the SD card; guest or password login
- **Android TV Remote** — control any Android / Google TV (Sony, NVIDIA Shield, Xiaomi Mi Box, Chromecast, …): scan → pair once with the on-screen PIN → on-screen remote (D-Pad, volume, media, power)
- **Global toggle** — WiFi is now an on/off switch like Bluetooth (from the lock menu); the connection persists across apps and reconnects automatically after a reboot

#### Mesh / Buddy *(ESP-NOW)*
Pair cheap headless ESP32 boards (**buddies**) to the T-Embed (**master**) over ESP-NOW to offload WiFi capture and run remote actions.
- Buddy discovery, pair/remove and live status from the lock menu → **Mesh Clients**
- **Device Identify** — make a paired buddy blink to locate it
- **WiFi handshake capture** — buddy passively captures EAPOL handshakes on a chosen channel (1–13)
- **Store-and-forward** — the buddy holds each complete handshake (M1–M4 + beacon) durably (RAM + NVS) per BSSID and delivers it as one acknowledged unit, surviving master absence and buddy reboots
- One `.pcap` per network written to `/ext/wifi/buddy_<name>_<ssid>.pcap`; "Handshake received" overlay on all mesh views
- Buddy firmware ships in this repo under [`buddy_firmware/`](buddy_firmware/) (standalone headless ESP-IDF project)

## Building

### Prerequisites

- **[ESP-IDF v5.4.1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.4.1/esp32s3/get-started/)** (exact version required)
- ESP-IDF export script sourced (default: `~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh`)

### Build & Flash (Linux / macOS)

```bash
# T-Embed (auto-detects /dev/cu.usbmodem*)
./buildAndFlash_T-Embed.sh

# Build only
./buildAndFlash_T-Embed.sh --build-only

# Waveshare ESP32-C6
./buildAndFlash_Waveshare_c6_1.47.sh
./buildAndFlash_Waveshare_c6_1.9.sh
```

### Build & Flash (Windows)

Use `winbuild.py` — a single CLI that wraps build, flash and serial-monitor steps for `cmd.exe` / PowerShell. Requires Python 3 and ESP-IDF v5.4.1 installed at `C:\Espressif\frameworks\esp-idf-v5.4.1` (or override via `ESP_IDF_DIR`).

```bat
:: One-time: install ESP-IDF python env
python winbuild.py setup

:: Verify the toolchain activates
python winbuild.py check

:: Build T-Embed CC1101 (default board)
python winbuild.py build

:: Build Waveshare ESP32-C6
python winbuild.py build --board waveshare_c6

:: Flash (port defaults to %ESPPORT% or COM14)
python winbuild.py flash --port COM14

:: Stream serial output for N seconds
python winbuild.py monitor --duration 30

:: Build + flash + monitor in one go
python winbuild.py all --port COM14
```

Boards: `t_embed` (default), `esp32s3`, `waveshare_c6` (or `waveshare_c6_1.9`), `waveshare_c6_1.47`. Override defaults with `ESP_IDF_DIR` and `ESPPORT` env vars. `monitor --reset` only works on USB-UART bridges, not on the ESP32-S3 native USB-Serial/JTAG — use `flash` or `all` to capture boot logs.

### Build a FAP

```bash
# Firmware must be built first (Linux/macOS)
./buildFap.sh applications/main/my_app
```

## Porting Approach

This port preserves the original Flipper Zero architecture as closely as possible:

- **Furi OS** runs on FreeRTOS with the same thread/mutex/event/record API
- **Services** (GUI, Input, Storage, Loader, Desktop, BT) use the same message-queue and record-system patterns
- **HAL** maps STM32 peripherals to ESP-IDF drivers (SPI → `esp_lcd`, I2C → CST816S/PN532, RMT → IR, Bluedroid → BLE, TinyUSB → USB-HID)
- **Display** renders the original 128×64 mono framebuffer, then 2× upscales to RGB565 for the color LCD
- **Applications** compile with minimal changes (`#include` path adjustments, no-op stubs for missing hardware like 1-Wire)
- **`malloc` is redefined to `calloc`** — STM32 heap starts zeroed, ESP32 does not
- **Crypto** is stubbed (no Flipper-Enclave key) — affects encrypted SubGHz keystores; everything else uses real mbedtls
